what is loop?

loop is a functional way of repeating certail terms and conditions till the certain condition has been done or set or seen 

in JavaAscript we have 5 types of loops 
1-for 
2-while
3-do-while
4-for-of
5-for-in
 

 so what are the diffrences ??

 first in for loop 
 the whole looping throw is gonna happen based on certail amount of time 
 that means the repetition  is here important 


 but in while loop 
 it execute the code on certain Conditions so that menas here the amount of the number doesnt matter only the condition matters here 


 and do while loop is same as while but the only thing is it is gonna execute atleast once event if the number given is 0

 For of loop is used to loop throw the values of an Object 
 like an array directly without useing an index 



 but  in the for in loop we loop throw the properties and if we wanna access the values we have to use the keys
