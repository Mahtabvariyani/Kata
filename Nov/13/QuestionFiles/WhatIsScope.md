what is Scope in JavaScript ??
that mean the variables which have beeen declared in a function scope can be accessable only within the scope of the function and if we try to console.log them outside or access the out side of the function scope it gives undefined 

that means Scope 


but in global scope which means the variable has been declared out side of the function scope can be accessable from everywhen in the script
