what ar ethe data TYpes in JavaScript?


so in the JavaScript we have 2 main data Types 

 primitive (String,Boolean,Number,Undefined,Null)

the Primitive data Types are Immuteable so that means their value can not be chaged 
so that means their value can not be changed or modified once created...
and the hold only single value ,
they are also simple values 

  and 
 
 None-Primitive (Object - Array-functions -date - Regular Expressions )
the None Primitive data Types can hold multiple values  and  they are miteable that means their value can be changed 
and they are complex not simple like Primitive data Types  

const Student = {
    name:'Sam',
    age=23,
    Single:true,
    address:[
        street:'Somewhere'
        houseNumber:20,
    ]
}
